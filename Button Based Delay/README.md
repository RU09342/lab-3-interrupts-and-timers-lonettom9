# Button Based Delay
## Objective
The objective here was to add additional functionality to the button interrupt using the TimerA peripheral. The goal was to making a program that starts out blinking, and the rate of the blink can be adjusted by how long a user holds down the button.
## Summary
The code from parts one and two of this lab were essentially integrated together to determine a way to allow user input through the MSP430 to determine the frequency at which the LED blinks. By using an if statement inside of the interrupt we are able to implement the user control. When the button is pressed we set the Timer to count up using "MC_2". We also set this to capture mode using "TA1CCTL0 = CAP;". An else if statement is used when the button is on the rising edge as well. We then set the TA0CCR0 equal to the value we obtained from TA1CCR0 in order to achieve the users input. In addition to this an additional function is used to calculate the number of cycles need to provide a 10Hz starting frequency.
## Code Differences
Pins all change of course, but the line of code "PM5CTL0 &= ~LOCKLPM5;"is required in order to disable the GPIO power-on default high-impedance mode for the 2311 and 6989. The 2311 has no TimerA so TimerB was used for that implementation.
